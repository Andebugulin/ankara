Hello, i did it for recalling some words, if you wanna try, you're welcome.

in excel put your words, meanings and examples
my program will classify data and auto input information about current date. so, do not worry about it.

This application similar to quizlet and to stuff like that.

How to use app:
I have a lot of cards, cards are located in the decks.
for moving to the next deck just click space or arrow to the right side
moving to the previous one is simple, click to the arrow to the left side.

use keyboard for short keys,
key f: for word
key d: for meaning
key s: for example

when you do not remember the meaning, do not hurry, watch the example and try to understand meaning by the context.
that was the reason why i did all this, for fun, ofc, but for education as well.

when you see card you may classify that card simply by clicking on the one of keys

click 1 if you do not remember the meaning of card.
click 2 if it was hard to recall or you wasted several attempts by remembering it.
click 3 if that was not hard, but you made it with no ease.
click 4 if you managed quicly
click 5 if you feel sorrow for everybody who has lost your jubilation.

GL, i will try to change it somehow soon, probably will change smth in the interface, i mean layout.

relax and reclining, buddy.
